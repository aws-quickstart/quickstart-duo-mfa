// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

After you launch the stack, verify your deployment and, if desired, modify your implementation, as described in the following sections.

=== Verify your deployment

. Verify that the Amazon ECS cluster contains the number of instances that you want. 
.. Open the Amazon ECS console.
.. In the left pane, choose *Clusters*.
.. Choose the *ECS Instances* tab.
. Verify the MFA configuration. 
.. Open the Directory Service console.
.. Select your directory.
.. Choose the *Networking & security* tab.
.. Find the *Multi-factor authentication* pane at the bottom of the page.
.. Verify that the RADIUS status is *Completed*. You may need to wait for the status to appear; Systems Manager can take a few minutes to register and configure the instances. If the status is *Failed*, see the link:#_troubleshooting[Troubleshooting] section of this guide.
.. Verify that the configuration otherwise looks as you expect. To change anything, choose *Actions*, *Edit*. (The RADIUS instances' IP addresses were generated by an AWS Fargate task. The shared secret code values are empty for security reasons.)
. Verify that MFA is working in an Amazon WorkSpaces client.
.. Open the Amazon WorkSpaces client.
.. Under the username and password boxes, in the third text box, enter the MFA code from the Duo Mobile app or the hardware security token mentioned earlier.
. If you chose directory synchronization earlier, synchronize users to Duo Cloud, and add hardware tokens.
.. Open the Duo administrator panel. Choose *Users* on the left side of screen, and choose *Directory Sync* near the top right. 
.. Enter the NTLM (Active Directory) domain and the NTLM workstation: the hostname of one of the Duo RADIUS ECS IP addresses (example: 10.0.10.10, 10.0.11.10).
.. At the bottom of the page, choose *Refresh*. This brings you to the top of the page, which instructs you to select a group to import.
.. At the bottom of the page, for *Groups*, enter the Active Directory user group you want to import into Duo. Choose *Save Groups*.
.. At the top of the page, select *Sync Now*.
.. On the left, choose *Users*. Review the user list that was imported from your Active Directory group. You should see details about the users that were imported from Active Directory as well as Duo-specific details.
.. Add hardware tokens. To do so, select a user, choose *Add Hardware Token*, enter the serial number of one of the tokens that you ordered, and then choose *Attach Hardware Token*.
. Update user settings for each user.
.. From the Duo administrator panel, choose *Users* on the left side of the screen, and select a user.
.. Choose the status—either *Active* or *Bypass*—to determine whether to require MFA when that user logs in.
.. (Optional) Add a phone number so that the user can use the Duo Mobile app.

=== Modify your implementation

If you want to increase or decrease the number of RADIUS tasks after deploying the Partner Solution, update the AWS CloudFormation stack and specify the desired number of servers. Then perform a stack update. If you increase the number of tasks, the Amazon ECS service starts up that number of new tasks and installs and configures the Duo Authentication Proxy service for each. 

. Open the AWS CloudFormation console.

. Choose your deployed Duo stack, and choose *Update*.

. Choose *Use current template*.

. Under *Specify stack details* section, find `RadiusProxyServerCount`, and choose the desired value. Wait until the message says that the service "has reached a steady state," as shown in <<duo_ecs_service_stable>>.

After each task is configured, the Amazon ECS service invokes an event that sends a notification that the service has reached a steady state, as shown in <<duo_ecs_service_stable>>.
